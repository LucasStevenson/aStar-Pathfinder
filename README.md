# A* Pathfinder

This program simulates a robot moving through a 2D grid containing randomly generated obstacles in order to reach some end goal. I used the A* pathfinding algorithm to compute the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point, and then visually simulated the robot moving through the grid using Pygame.
